CI/CD Integration & Test Execution
QA Testers Task: Integrate automated test scripts into a CI/CD pipeline

Objectives
- Integrate automated API test scripts into the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
- Ensure that tests are automatically triggered on code changes like commits or pull requests.
- Execute API tests using Newman through the CI/CD pipeline and validate the execution process.
- Generate test reports from Newman execution and ensure they are accessible and properly structured.

Deliverables
- CI/CD Pipeline Configuration File:
  A GitHub Actions YAML file that integrates the automated API test execution.
- Automated Postman Test Collections:
  Postman collections (including pre-request and post-request scripts), with properly organized API tests for all product features.
- Test Execution Report:
  A detailed test execution report generated by Newman shows the success/failure of each test, as well as performance metrics and logs.
